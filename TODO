Things I plan on doing, in no particular order:

Priority

- be able to download an entire album as a zip file
- "granddaddy" playlist with all songs
- "test" versus "production" site urls and specify which when building
- sort the genres and tags alphabetically

The rest

- the ability to play a shuffle of all songs in an album/playlist
- continue refining styling
- some kind of page layout
- add offline feedback capability (form writes a file to server that gets syncedback to the desktop for review
- utility to check mp3s for problems(and possibly correct them) before running the main script 
- additional files of narrative that aren't part of the ID3 tags, that can be mapped to the files and displayed
- ditto for additional notes on albums
- extra pages that aren't directly tied to the songs, like an "about" page
- tip jar
- ranking of playlists
- Explore by Artist
